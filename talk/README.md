The Internet of Things (IoT) is starting to become more and more prevalent in daily life. There are low-power, smart devices everywhere and with the increasing affordability of such devices, IoT is only going to gain more ground. This workshop aims to introduce the core idea behind automation in the context of home automation using a web app and a Particle Photon.

## Rockwell Automation

As an industrial automation company, Rockwell has a vested interest in the proliferation of these affordable, low-power, smart devices because they can be used to access data from the shop floor of a production facility in ways that were previously impractical.

Along with these connected devices, IoT has also encouraged a larger focus on web and mobile development. We have embraced the mobile-first strategy and are working on creating data paths from connected devices across a facility to a common platform.

## Automation

Sensors collect data which is then passed to something that makes decisions based on that data and may also even pass that data along to something that knows how to display it. This is the core idea behind automation. This is true for a cookie oven in a factory and for the smart lights in houses. It all works on the same principle.
