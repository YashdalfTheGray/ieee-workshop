IEEE SAC 2016 Workshop

## Setup Instructions
There are 3 things that you will need to download and install before the workshop:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Download")
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node Download")
* A text editor (see below)

Please get these installed before you show up, it will just make it easier the day of.  If you have any trouble getting them installed or questions don't hesitate to email me.  I was in your shoes not too long ago, don't worry about asking questions, that's how we learn.
###What are these things?
#####If you've never used these before, here's the short explanation to what they are and why we need them.
####[git](https://git-scm.com/)
tldr; git is the tool we will use to download the code repository we'll be using for the workshop from the web to your local computer.  Check out the [site](https://git-scm.com/) and try the online [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) if you're interested in learning more.  Yes, it uses the command line; no need to be scared, it's easy once you get the hang of it.  No need to do anything with git except install it, if you don't already know, we'll show you everything else at the workshop!

####[nodejs](https://www.nodejs.org/)
tldr; we really are using nodejs on your machine for it's package management tool, npm.  What is npm?  In short, it allows me to give you a tiny file with a list of packages in it, then npm will read that file, run out to the web and download all of those things and install them in the code repository for our project to use.  If you want to learn a little bit of node, a great resource is [nodeschool.io](www.nodeschool.io)

####text editor
#####We're engineers, we have great tools to make our lives easier!
You're going to need something to write code with in the workshop.  While all of the files we are working with are simply text files that you could open with notepad, it gets very difficult to open and close files if you are browsing around.  There's lots of editors out there for programmers, take your pick, if you don't know, heres some suggestions.
